                      - I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where I can contribute to both the technical and strategic aspects of a project.
